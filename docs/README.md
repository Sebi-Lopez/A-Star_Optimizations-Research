# Introduction
This is a research made by the student [Sebastià López tenorio](https://github.com/Sebi-Lopez) for the subject Project II of the bachelor's degree in [Design and Development of Videogames](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/) from the UPC, with lecturer Ricard Pillosu. 

# Current Position

In videogames, the use of a pathfinding algorithm is crucial when dealing with all sorts of movements. 
The algorithm that we are using now, the A*, as many of you know, can be really slow. Most of all when we have to deal with a greater number of unities. At a certain number of unities demanding path, the algorithm becomes unusable. Either the entities take too long to respond (to get the actual path) making them look dummy or the FPS of the game drop (disaster). This problem grows exponentially with the size of the requested path. 

It's for this reason we are going to find an alternative to this algorithm, to get to the point when we can spawn entities "without worrying" about the pathfinding.
